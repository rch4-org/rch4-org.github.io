In fact, it is scarce and\_immensely expensive.\n\nDue to the lack of any external source of funding,\_we must pay\_the cost ourselves\_as a charitable undertaking, therefore the number of patients we can afford to treat\_is very limited. Accordingly,\_we avoid\_publicity or recognition. From time to time when we can afford\_to treat more PALS, we publish\_a temporary 'Contact us' page\_inviting those who may be interested to apply for help.\nIn every country, we must comply with both their laws and medical ethics. We require some documentation before we could consider helping you which includes an evaluation form, confirmed written diagnosis of ALS or MND from a neurology clinic, a recent blood test, doctor's prescription, Informed Patient Consent - and so on.\n\nYou may have issues that would preclude you from using this drug.\n"

        content: "Notwithstanding no side effects\_over more than eighty patient-treatment years,\_and slowing or stopping the progression, the current status of this drug is experimental.\n\nWe cannot afford to do blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Accordingly, although there exist decades of\_clinical data indicating notable safety and efficacy over decades\_of patient-years, in the absence of a 6-month\_trial (costing $millions)\_RCH4 must still be considered as an unproven treatment.\n\nDo not expect a cure - that\_is extremely\_unlikely and probably impossible with existing technology.\_The terms 'ALS' and 'MND' are commonly used as the same thing, whereas, strictly speaking there may be\_small differences in the definition. There is no clear biomarker (\"test\") for ALS and is difficult to diagnose. In fact, ALS is probably a number of very different diseases that 'present' (the observed symptoms) the same. An example would be Lyme disease. These are referred to as 'mimics' If not entirely different diseases, they are at least different subtypes of the\_disease. Accordingly, one single drug or treatment is\_unlikely to be effective for\_all patients.\n\nWhereas increasing knowledge of the genetic mutations PFN1, SOD1, TLS/FUS, TPD43, C9orf72, etc.,\_adds to the understanding of ALS pathogenesis, it also underlines the heterogeneity of ALS.\n\nNeurodegenerative conditions very rarely improve - if ever. This outlook may now be changing, but there can be no guarantees or assurances of efficacy. Whereas it is imperative that one maintains a positive mental attitude and optimism, likewise, it is most important not to acquire\_unrealistic expectations.A respected Professor of Neurology and a Principal Investigator for ALS clinical trials, Dr. Jeremy Shefner, wisely observed: *\"As a community, we are all vulnerable to being overly hopeful and accepting\_on face value, preliminary data that is expressed positively.”*\n\nRCH4 may not help you - people differ in their response\_to any medication. Whether or not you ask us\_for treatment is\_your decision.\n\nOn the basis of the current limited available evidence at this time ( >\_6,000 doses by 2018), it may\_or probably slow\_the statistical progression of your ALS. Some may have views about the implications of living longer. (refer to [rch4 efficacy](/about_rch4/#efficacy)).\n\nFor some PALS, it stops the decline\_(it\_stabilizes) of\_their ALSFRS-R score condition over time. Indeed for some - years. You should also consider the implications of this.\n\nALS is a highly variable condition and PALS are also highly variable in their response to treatment. Random charts for RCH4 which may be\_representative of the overall ALS population can be seen [**here.**](https://rch4.org/random-examples)\n\nAlthough RCH4 has an outstanding safety record and no notable related side effects\_have ever been reported to date\_after decades of continual patient-treatment years, there is always the\_potential for side effects\_with any drug. You would take RCH4\_entirely at your own risk.\n"
