      - question: Fake counterfeit ALS drugs?
        answer: "They are widely available from online \"reputable\" so-called \"non-profit\" entities. These counterfeits mostly originate from China and India. We estimate that some 30% of all ALS\_drugs (by value) in circulation are now counterfeit.\_***Under no circumstances***\_buy these lower-cost fakes.\_Commonly, their\_*modus operandi*\_is to offer free telephone \"advice\" or\_\"consultation\", which in essence is a sales pitch for their counterfeit drugs. Sometimes their \"doctor\" issues the prescription. A medical doctor cannot legally issue a treatment prescription without examining the patient and/or having access to the patients' complete clinical file and history.\_\nDo not send them money, especially to those whose website registration is hidden by a proxy and cannot be traced.\n"
