      - question: Fake counterfeit ALS drugs?
        answer: "They are widely available from online \"reputable\" so-called \"non-profit\" entities. These counterfeits mostly originate from China and India. We estimate that some 30% of all ALS\_drugs (by value) in circulation are now counterfeit.\_***Under no circumstances***\_buy these lower-cost fakes.\_Commonly, their\_*modus operandi*\_is to offer free telephone \"advice\" or\_\"consultation\", which in essence is a sales pitch for their counterfeit drugs. Sometimes their \"doctor\" issues the prescription. A medical doctor cannot legally issue a treatment prescription without examining the patient and/or having access to the patients' complete clinical file and history.\_\nDo not send them money, especially to those whose website registration is hidden by a proxy and cannot be traced.\n"

      - question: Stem cell treatment?
        answer: "Unless a formal, authorized clinical trial, again,\_***under no circumstances*** consider stem cell treatment from any of the many clinics advertising their services in this field. None of them can demonstrate any evidence of realistic efficacy, there are confirmed\_reports of some catastrophic outcomes and they charge very large sums of money.\nEven FDA-approved formal stem cell trials have never demonstrated a long-term slowing of the progression. If your clinic is reputable, they will advise you of this\_under the rules of \"Informed Patient Consent\".\n"

      - question: Exercise?
        answer: "Whereas doctors\_rightly recommend that their patient should exercise to keep limbs and joints flexible as possible, but that must not be interpreted as doing workouts in\_the gym - or whatever.\nA physical therapist may be\_likely\_to set exertion goals for the patient to achieve - which is well-meaning, but a\_very\_bad idea and counterproductive for a PALS. Stretching is good, but not strenuous exertion.\nPALS are hypermetabolic, therefore should avoid strenuous exercise, conserve energy and focus on trying to\_maintain, or increase\_weight.\n"

          What is considered by neurologists to be the definition of an
          effective drug for ALS?  (also known as "MND" Motor Neuron Disease)?
        answer: "The\_Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) did a survey of clinicians\_and clinical researchers who concluded\_that any therapy that resulted in a change of 20% or greater in the slope of the ALSFRS-R would be clinically meaningful, but\_there was no therapy available to achieve it at that time.\nHowever, it would now appear that the clinical evidence indicates that RCH4 far exceeds the safety and efficacy of any treatment to date.\n\nWe must rely on the monthly monitoring reports from our PALS friends in fourteen\_countries (86% Europe & North America. Four Ethnicities) over some years, the accuracy of which we cannot independently verify.\nAccordingly, we make no claims about efficacy nor do we offer any interpretation of the data (as treatment is ongoing, data can change).\nThere are many reports on the Internet by\_users\_of RCH4 discussing\_safety and efficacy.\_For example, the\_'[**Patients Like Me**](https://www.patientslikeme.com/forum/als/topics/158688?page=8)' forum\_is possibly the most accurate and reliable forum on the Internet. However there are very minor errors in their software, e.g. total numbers of patients do not tally, starting dates are not all correct, number\_of evaluations do not tally exactly, etc.\n"
