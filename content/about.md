We are an informal charity group of retired scientists with lifetimes of experience in membrane osmosis and immunity research.​\
A scientist in our group discovered a previously unknown agent (referred to as \`MRCH\`) which is produced by the body and which promotes ALS (aka MND). ​​​ We have designed a drug which safely stops production of the problem agent. 

We never ask PALS or the public for money. We always funded treatment personally and with help from friends.​ As a charity, we also try to obtain, worldwide, voluntary unpaid domestic help for PALS and their care givers when they are in a crises

# Our History

There was no effective drug for the condition. The only drug approved for it \`Riluzole\` had very limited efficacy at best. As there was an urgent unmet medical need and we had discovered what may be a far better treatment, it fell to us as a humanitarian imperative to do something about it  by offering the discovery to those who could bring it to ALS patients to be tested - to prove if it could slow, or more optimistically, maybe stop the progression or perhaps even eventually lead to some recovery.  
To do that would require clinical trials (costing millions) to satisfy the Regulatory Authorities. We prepared scientific presentations and compelling clinical evidence of the efficacy and mode of action of the drug. Scientific presentations were then made, in person, worldwide, to the major players in the Pharmaceutical Industry. They showed no interest whatever.  

In 2012, the package was offered as [a gift to the ALS Research entities](https://www.als-new-drug.com/mnd-offer). Scientific presentations were, again made in person, to the ALS research community.  
At various times, outstanding clinical data was brought to the attention of other major research players including the ALS Association Chief Scientist Dr. Lucy Brujyn and the MND Association Head of Research [Dr. Belinda Cupid](https://www.als-new-drug.com/cupid).  
We were ignored.​ 

**In general:**
Many of the world\`s pre-eminent neurologists were contacted and RCH4 was met either with hostility or they failed to reply.​
We tried to get assistance from Globally known Philanthropists, and the ALS funding sources. Repeatedly they declined to help us. ​No more could be done.
