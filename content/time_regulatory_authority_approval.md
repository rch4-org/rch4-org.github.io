Of crucial importance to a person with ALS/MND is the fact that there will be no cure approved (even if one existed right now) until after the expected life span of some 90% of PALS.\
However, some who are taking one of the only two drugs which do have notable efficacy in extending life could have a realistic prospect of seeing major improvement in treatment.​​

RCH4 may statistically increase life expectancy by ~ threefold or far more, although we do not make any claims, nor offer any interpretation of our clinical data which is provided by PALS themselves worldwide.​
