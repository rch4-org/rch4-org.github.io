    title: Mode of Action
    content: >
      *Note: These paragraphs are not intended to be a scientific discussion but
      a conceptualised broad overview for the average reader.*


      This new ALS drug targets a newly found agent ("defect") in the immune
      system. The fact the the drug, a type of molecule somewhat similar to a
      monoclonal antibody and reported to be safe, fixes that defect is now
      certain and undoubted. However, there may other unknown antagonistic
      agents involved.\

      The defect is also certainly a factor in the promotion or stimulation of
      ALS, however it may not be the only defect. There may be others as the
      aetiology is not clearly understood.


      **TO REWORD**  

      In essence, the extensive evidence that this new drug which targets
      dysfunctional lipid rafts is effective in slowing the disease progression
      across the entire severity spectrum of ALS including both sporadic and
      familial cases, proving that it targets the primary initiating mechanism
      of the disease process.


      ## The target


      A specific B-cell sub set was identified as the source of the newly
      recognised agent (operationally termed MRCH) which, in turn, upregulates
      the expression of a protein, which in excess, is excitotoxic. The B-cell
      sub set lipid raft receptors were characterised and a molecule developed
      which recognises that receptor and nothing else - therefore indicating a
      notably safe Mode Of Action (MOA) profile. This has been confirmed after
      very many decades of continual-patient-years treatment.

    title: Monthly Report
    content: >
      Patient taking RCH4 are asked to send a report on a monthly basis
      providing their ALSFRS-R score.  [A peer reviewed
      paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/17482968.2011.633268)
      confirms that self-evaluation of the ALSFRS-R score concurs almost
      precisely with the same evaluations done in clinic.


      The monthly monitoring reports also track the drugs and all dietary
      supplements taken by PALS who are being treated with RCH4. Whether or not
      you are taking RCH4, we do not recommend taking supplements without you
      specifically discussing the topic with your doctor.

    title: Efficacy
    content: >
      Based on PALS monthly report we know that:


      *   31% of patients exhibit 6 months or more stability


      *   52% 4 months or more stability.


      *   14% are non responders, i.e., the drug has no effect for them.


      It should be noted that although the ALSFRS-R score is the gold standard
      for decline measurement, it does not include factors such as
      get-up-and-go, strength etc. It should also be remembered that the
      ALSFRS-R score may not reflect loss of motor neurons.\

      However, it is logical and true to observe that, for example, if the
      ALSFRS-R score does not change, then end of life would be due to something
      else - or extreme old age.


      Efficacy evidence of RCH4 in slowing the progression of ALS, independently
      reported by PALS themselves, can be seen bellow.

If it has [**Regulatory Authority**](/time_regulatory_authority_approval) marketing approval\n\n2.  If it is in a clinical trial.\\\n    A clinical trial requires Regulatory Authotity permission and a large number of patients. It typically costs (the clinic charges and the drug) Euro 17,000 ($19,000 US) to treat each patient in a trial.\_We cannot\_afford to do clinical trials.\n\n3.  If the Authorities grant\_permission for compassionate use.\\\n    A doctor makes an application for permission\_to treat the patient on compassionate grounds. This is normally only granted in a case where the patient is very ill and not responding to existing drugs or where there is no effective drug\_for the disease in question. There is no Regulatory Authority approved drug to cure\_ALS.\n\n4.  In accordance with\_the \"right to try\" rules.\\\n    Most countries have some mechanism to allow a patient to use\_an experimental new drug. Rules differ and can be\_very complex and time consuming to deal with. We cannot help in advising about the local regulations in the country where you live.\n    It is for a doctor to decide to allow you to take RCH4.\_You would need to discuss this\_with him or her and get written permission. Also, other paperwork is required, e.g. Informed Consent, copies of Neurologists diagnosis etc.\n\nAlso, before we start with a\_new patient, we must be sure that we will have sufficient supply of the drug to reliably provide treatment for the new patient for a long time. Existing PALS must have priority.​ Accordingly we can only accept small numbers of patients.\n\nIf we could, we would supply anyone who would benefit.\n\nThere is also the fact that it can take\_up to 4\_months to have each batch\_manufactured and we must have the funds to pay the Pharmaceutical drug manufacturer\_in advance. Their minimum production run order keeps our existing PALS friends supplied for over one year.​\nThe only way forward to make it permanently available worldwide for everyone, will be the involvement of a Pharmaceutical company or PALS themselves set up their own commercial entity to obtain Regulatory Authority marketing approval for their own medical and financial benefit.\n"
