    title: RCH4 - a new ALS drug
    content: "## At a glance\n\n*   For 86% of ALS/MND patients, progression is slowed by 65% therefore\_a ~ threefold increase in life\_expectancy. No other drug can do\_this.\n\n*   The evidence is from >80 continual patient-treatement-years.\n\n*   There are no related side effects.\n\n*   For 16% of these subjects,\_on average it safely stabilises their condition for\_years.\n\n*   Provided\_free of charge by this charity (when funding is available)\_to anyone asking for help.\n\n*   14% of RCH4 patients\_are non-responders, i.e. RCH4 has no effect for them.\n\n*   ​Unfortunately, it is not a cure and no cure exists yet.\n\nAlso, we cannot afford to do blinded, placebo controlled clinical trials.Accordingly, although there is decades of\_clinical data indicating notable safety and efficacy over decades\_of patient-years, in the absence of a 6 months\_trial (costing $millions)\_RCH4 must still be considered as an unproven treatment.\n"

    title: Comparaisons with other treatments
    content: "## Riluzole™\n\n*also known as \\`Rilutek\\`*\n\n**Riluzole™**\_was originally used in a photographic developing solution, and later as an industrial bleach. It was accidentally screened in an in-vitro assay of glutamate inhibition and found to be slightly effective.\_\nThe first\_approved ALS drug \\`Riluzole\\`™ (Sanofi Aventis) may\_not slow the progression rate sufficient to reflect in the ALSFRS-R score.\nIt extends \"time to tracheotomy\"\_by 75 days + - 15 days\_(*Source*: *Sanofi)*. This data emanates from a very large study of some 900 ALS patients. Extended time to tracheotomy\_does not necessarily equate to life extension. It does not appear to slow the progression of ALS.\nSlowing or stopping the progression does equate to life extension - provided that infections or other events are avoided.\nAs far as is known, no ALSFRS-R decline charts have been published for \\`Riluzole\\`™ by the manufacturer.\n\n## Radicava™\n\n**Radicava™**\_(*Mitsubishi Tenabe Japan*)\_\_(also known as Edaravone) is a form of Pyrazoline, (of which there are many derivatives including Edaravone)\_an industrial laboratory reagent used in synthesis of peptides and making experiments more sensitive.\_It is used to treat stroke victims. It is the second ALS drug to gain marketing approval in the USA.\_It slows the progression of ALS by 33% for six months and\_is effective in 7% of\_PALS\_(Data 2016 *Source*: *Mitsubishi\_Tanabe*). It was approved\_in USA after a small 6 month clinical trial in selected patients in Japan\_that met a specific exclusion criteria. In 93% of PALS it had no efficacy in earlier trials. A follow-on trial\_of 12 months duration failed to show any statistical significance of efficacy\\[1]. Application for approval in Europe was withdrawn.\n\n*1: Source www.tandfonline.com*\n\n## RCH4\n\n**RCH4**\_is the first and only drug developed specifically for ALS. It\_slows the progression of PALS by 63% (non-responders included, 70% slowing of progression when the 16% non-responders are excluded)\_and\_is effective in 84% of PALS over the whole treated population\\[1]\n\nRCH4 does not have Regulatory Authority marketing approval as we do not have the millions needed to gain approval. As a charity, PALS\_treated with RCH4 are\_not selected or subject to any exclusion criteria as it is done for clinical trials. Everyone asking for help is accepted if possible. Prior careful selection of candidates for clinical trials who are likely to do better, skews efficacy data in favour of the drug being tested in the\_trial - which can be\_misleading. RCH4 is provided as a charity, not a clinical trial.\n\n*1: Data 2017\\* Source: Patients own monthly monitoring reports >4,000 datum points*\n"
